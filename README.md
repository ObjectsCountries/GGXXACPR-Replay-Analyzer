# GGXXACPR Replay Analyzer

This simple GUI app displays information gathered from *Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R* replays, and plots them onto graphs.

## How To Use

Simply enter your username, select the folder with the replays (the app should go to the correct one by default), and click either of the buttons at the bottom.

Selecting a folder is not necessary unless your replays are not in the default folder (C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Documents\\ARC SYSTEM WORKS\\GGXXAC\\Replays on Windows).

The left button will make a JSON out of every file in the replay folder, and the right button shows the aforementioned graphs. **Note that you do not need to make the JSONs before viewing the graphs.**

Once the second window has opened, select your character. The "Switch View" button will switch between a scatter plot, a bar graph of matchup win rates, and a bar graph of matches played, all for the selected character. The "Sort View" button will sort the bar graphs from highest to lowest, with the average always at the bottom.
