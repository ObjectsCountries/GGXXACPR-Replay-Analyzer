# GGXXACPR Replay Analyzer

This simple GUI app displays information gathered from *Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R* replays, and plots them onto graphs.

## How To Use

Simply enter your username, select the folder with the replays (the app should go to the correct one by default), and click either of the buttons at the bottom.

The left button will make a JSON out of every file in the replay folder, and the right button shows the aforementioned graphs.
